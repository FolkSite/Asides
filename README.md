## Asides

Asides is a MODX Extra allowing you (and your clients) to easyly manage "asides" on a website.
You'll be able to quickly create chunks without having acces to the Elements tab (and even without the new_chunk,
right).

## Configuration

Install via package manager.
Setup the asides.categoryId to fit your needs.

## Credits

This Extra is base on some MODX community members, see :

It also makes use of MadeMyDay's sortable checkbox TV :
